## Project Overview

**JumpLander Coder** is the codebase and integration layer for JumpLander — an Iranian LLM-powered coding assistant and IDE augmentation platform. The platform offers features such as:

- Auto code generation and completion  
- Refactoring and automatic code improvements  
- Language-aware static analysis and security scanning  
- Build/test suggestions and CI templating  
- Agent orchestration (task-specific AI agents for refactor, review, test generation)  
- In-browser IDE integration and a REST API for programmatic access

This repository contains the work done to implement the platform's core interactions, example integrations, and developer documentation for third-party integrators.

---

## What I built (work completed)

This section summarizes the work already completed on the project — what is implemented in this repository:

1. **Backend service (API gateway)**  
   - REST API that proxies requests to the AI inference layer and provides unified endpoints for code generation, refactor, review, and security scanning.  
   - Request validation, rate-limiting stubs, and basic authentication middleware.

2. **Frontend (Web IDE integration / client)**  
   - A minimal in-browser editor integration that demonstrates: inline code suggestions, "Fix security issues" modal, and a "Generate test" action.  
   - Example connectors for Monaco Editor and CodeMirror (sample components).

3. **Agent orchestration layer**  
   - A small task-runner that coordinates multi-step agent flows (e.g., `analyze -> propose-fix -> apply-refactor -> test-run`).  
   - Configurable pipelines (YAML/JSON) to define agent steps and timeouts.

4. **SDK examples & utilities**  
   - Example Python and JavaScript SDK wrappers to call the API easily.  
   - Utility functions for streaming responses, chunked code patch application, and applying diffs.

5. **CI and tests**  
   - Basic unit tests for core utilities and CI pipeline templates (GitHub Actions) for linting and running tests.

6. **Docker and deployment configs**  
   - Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` for local development (API + frontend + mock model service + DB).

7. **Documentation**  
   - This README (complete documentation), code comments, and example `openapi.yaml` stub for the REST API.

## Architecture

High-level architecture:

```
+----------------+       +----------------------+      +--------------------+
|  Frontend (UI) | <---> |  API Gateway / App   | <---> |  Agent Orchestrator |
|  (Monaco/React) |      |  (Node/Python/Go)   |      |  (Task pipelines)   |
+----------------+       +----------------------+      +--------------------+
                                  |
                                  v
                       +---------------------------+
                       |  Model Serving / LLMs     |
                       | (internal or external)    |
                       +---------------------------+
                                  |
                 +----------------+-------------------+
                 |                                    |
           +-----------+                         +-----------+
           | Database  |                         |  Object   |
           | (Postgres)|                         |  Storage  |
           +-----------+                         +-----------+
```

Components:
- **Frontend**: React-based IDE UI and plugin to show suggestions, diffs, and apply patches.  
- **API Gateway**: Central REST API for authentication, routing to different services, logging, and billing/rate limiting.  
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Manages multi-step flows and long-running tasks, can enqueue background jobs.  
- **Model Serving**: Hosts LLM endpoints (could be self-hosted or through a 3rd-party provider).  
- **Storage**: Postgres for metadata, S3-compatible storage for user files and artifacts.

## Quickstart — Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Git  
- Node.js >= 16 (if running frontend)  
- Python >= 3.9 (if using Python SDK or backend components)  
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended for easy local setup)  
- Make (optional)

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Osodyssey/jumplander-coder.git
cd jumplander-coder
```

### Environment

Create `.env` (example in `.env.example`):

```
JUMPLANDER_API_KEY=changeme
JUMPLANDER_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/jumplander
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Start with Docker Compose

If `docker-compose.yml` exists:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start:
- API server on `http://localhost:8080`
- Frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
- Mock model service or queue workers if configured

### Run services locally (no Docker)

Backend (example Node):

```bash
cd server
npm install
export JUMPLANDER_API_KEY="..."
npm run dev
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API Documentation & Examples

> The API path and payloads below are illustrative. Replace with your `openapi.yaml` endpoints.

### Endpoints (examples)

- `POST /api/v1/code/generate` — Generate code for a prompt  
- `POST /api/v1/code/refactor` — Request a refactor operation on source and return a diff/patch  
- `POST /api/v1/code/review` — Run a code review and get issues/suggestions  
- `POST /api/v1/security/scan` — Run static security checks and suggestions  
- `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}` — Check status for long-running agent jobs

### Example: Generate code (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST "$JUMPLANDER_API_URL/code/generate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JUMPLANDER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "language": "python",
    "prompt": "Implement an efficient fibonacci function with memoization",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "max_tokens": 600
  }'
```

Sample JSON response:

```json
{
  "id": "gen_123abc",
  "status": "completed",
  "language": "python",
  "result": "def fibonacci(n, memo={}):\n    if n in memo: return memo[n]\n    if n <= 1: return n\n    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)\n    return memo[n]"
}
```

### Example: Refactor request (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST "$JUMPLANDER_API_URL/code/refactor" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JUMPLANDER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "language": "js",
    "source": "function sum(a,b){return a+b}",
    "goal": "Make this function typed and add validation and unit tests",
    "mode": "safety-first"
  }'
```

Response contains a patch/diff and an explanation.

## SDK Examples (Python & JavaScript)

### Python (requests)

```python
import os
import requests

API_URL = os.getenv("JUMPLANDER_API_URL", "https://api.jumplander.org/v1")
API_KEY = os.getenv("JUMPLANDER_API_KEY")

def generate_code(prompt, lang="python"):
    url = f"{API_URL}/code/generate"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    payload = {"language": lang, "prompt": prompt, "temperature": 0.0}
    r = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=60)
    r.raise_for_status()
    return r.json()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    out = generate_code("Write a fast prime checker in python")
    print(out.get("result"))
```

### JavaScript (node / fetch)

```javascript
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

const API_URL = process.env.JUMPLANDER_API_URL || "https://api.jumplander.org/v1";
const API_KEY = process.env.JUMPLANDER_API_KEY;

async function generateCode(prompt, language="javascript") {
  const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/code/generate`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt, language, temperature: 0.2 })
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(await res.text());
  return res.json();
}

generateCode("Create a debounced input component in React")
  .then(r => console.log(r.result))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

---

## Frontend Integration (IDE example)

- **Monaco Editor plugin**: use the SDK to stream suggestions and show inline code actions.  
- **Action flow**:
  1. User selects a code block and presses "Refactor".  
  2. Client sends `POST /code/refactor` with selected code and desired goal.  
  3. API responds with a patch/diff.  
  4. UI shows diff preview; user accepts to apply.

### Patch application example (pseudo)

```js
// server returns unified diff
const diff = response.patch;

// use a library like 'diff' or apply via three-way merge
applyPatchToEditor(diff);
```

## Model & Agent Details

- This project assumes an **Iranian AI model** or model endpoint optimized for Persian and technical prompts.  
- Agents are configured as step-based pipelines where each step can:
  - make API calls to generation/review endpoints,
  - run static analyzers,
  - modify files,
  - create tests and run them in sandboxed containers.

**Agent config example (YAML)**

```yaml
name: security-fix-agent
steps:
  - analyze: { tool: "static-analyzer", args: ["--level", "high"] }
  - generate_fix: { tool: "jumpgen", prompt_template: "fix_security_issues" }
  - test: { tool: "run-tests", args: ["--timeout", 60] }
  - report: { tool: "create-report" }
```

> Replace `jumpgen` with your actual model service name and endpoint.

---

## Security & Privacy

- Always store API keys securely (secret manager). Do not commit `.env` to git.  
- Use TLS for all remote API calls.  
- Sanitize and audit user-supplied code before executing it in any runner. Use sandbox containers and resource constraints.  
- Consider opt-in telemetry and clear retention policies (e.g.: logs anonymized after 30 days).  
- If handling user code from Iran, comply with local laws and privacy expectations; maintain transparent policies in a `PRIVACY.md`.

---

## Testing & CI

- Tests: unit tests for utilities, integration tests for endpoints (use test doubles for model).  
- Sample GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Install
        run: npm ci
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
```

---

## Deployment (Docker & Production Tips)

- Use multi-stage Docker builds to keep images small.  
- Protect secrets with environment variable stores or cloud secret managers.  
- Scale model-serving separately from API. Use autoscaling based on queue length or latency.  
- Monitor with Sentry/Prometheus/Grafana; setup alerts for model latency and error rates.

Example `Dockerfile` (simple):

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

---

## Roadmap & TODOs

- Publish official SDK packages (PyPI, npm).  
- Harden security scanning and integrate third-party static analyzers.  
- Add role-based access control (RBAC) and larger team feature sets.  
- Add telemetry dashboard for agent runs and LLM usage.  
- Add sample integrations (GitHub App / GitLab MR bot).

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Steps:

1. Fork repository and create a feature branch: `feature/your-feature`.  
2. Write tests for your changes.  
3. Ensure linting and formatting passes.  
4. Open PR and include a clear description + testing steps.

Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (templates are recommended).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check `JUMPLANDER_API_KEY`.  
- **Model timeouts**: Increase request timeout or use async job endpoints.  
- **Patches fail to apply**: Ensure diff format matches patch library and line endings are consistent.
